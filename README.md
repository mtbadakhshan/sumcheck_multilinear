# Sumcheck protocol for Multilinear polynomials
A python implementation of sumcheck protocol for multilinear polynomials. Sumcheck protocol is useful in interactive proofs (IP). 

## Todo List: 
- Completed: A sparse representation and evaluation oracle for multilinear function. 
- Completed: An Interative Verifier. 
- Completed: A naive prover, taking O(n*2^n) time. 
- Completed: A faster prover using dynamic programming taking O(2^n) time. (Reference: Xie, Zhang, Zhang, Papamanthou, Song, 2019, https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/317.pdf)
- Todo: A non-interactive verifier using random oracle based on SHA256 (using Fiat-Shamir Transform). 
- TBD
